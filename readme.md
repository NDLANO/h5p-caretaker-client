# H5P Caretaker client
Reference implementation of a JavaScript client using the H5P Caretaker library.

## Usage
This is not supposed to run standalone. You will need a server component to run this,
please see e.g. https://github.com:ndlano/h5p-caretaker-server for a server side
reference implementation.

## TODO
Document what needs to be implemented ...
